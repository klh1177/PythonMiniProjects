# PythonMiniProjects
This contains numerous small little projects and programs written in the Python Language, either initially for fun or learning purposes.

Some programs in this repo were initially created in the CodeHS sandbox, and have been moved over to VS 2022 as to keep them in existence long after the code
HS account is gone. These include:
  - Random Number Generator: Creates a number of "random" numbers to a certain number of digits, useful for semi-random sampling
  - Name Generator: Creates a given number of names, created by randomly selected vowels and consonants
  - Mini ChatBot: Interactive program that gives the appearance of a chatbot trial using if statements
  - PIG: The classic game of PIG against an NPC - roll to win, but don't get a 1
